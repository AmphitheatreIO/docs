is Amphitheatre?\nAmphitheatre is an open source developer platform that facilitates continuous\ndevelopment of applications and microservices. You can iterate your application\nsource code locally, then deploy to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster, just\nlike docker build &amp;&amp; kubectl apply or docker-compose up. Amphitheatre handles\nthe workflow of building, pushing, and deploying applications. It also provides\nbuilding blocks and describes customization of CI/CD pipelines.\nFeatures\n\n\nFast local Kubernetes Development\n\n\nOptimized “Source to Kubernetes” - Amphitheatre detects changes in\nyour source code and handles the pipeline to build, push, test\nand deploy your application automatically with policy-based image\ntagging and highly optimized, fast local workflows\n\n\nContinuous feedback - Amphitheatre automatically manages deployment\nlogging and resource port-forwarding\n\n\n\n\nAmphitheatre projects work everywhere\n\n\nShare with other developers - Amphitheatre is the easiest way to\nshare your project with the world: git clone and amp run\n\n\nContext aware - use Amphitheatre profiles, local user config,\nenvironment variables, and flags to easily incorporate differences across\nenvironments\n\n\nCI/CD building blocks - use amp build, amp test and amp deploy\nas part of your CI/CD pipeline, or simply amp run end-to-end\n\n\nGitOps integration - use amp render to build your images and render\ntemplated Kubernetes manifests for use in GitOps workflows\n\n\n\n\n.amp.toml - a single pluggable, declarative configuration for your project\n\n\namp init - Amphitheatre can discover your build and deployment\nconfiguration and generate a Amphitheatre config\n\n\nMulti-component apps - Amphitheatre supports applications with many\ncomponents, making it great for microservice-based applications\n\n\nBring your own tools - Amphitheatre has a pluggable architecture,\nallowing for different implementations of the build and deploy stages\n\n\n\n\nLightweight\n\nMinimal pipeline - Amphitheatre provides an opinionated, minimal\npipeline to keep things simple\n\n\n\nWorkflow\nAmphitheatre simplifies your development workflow by organizing common\ndevelopment stages into one simple command. Every time you run amp dev, the\nsystem\n\nCollects and watches your source code for changes\nSyncs files directly to pods if user marks them as syncable\nBuilds artifacts from the source code\nTests the built artifacts using\ncontainer-structure-tests\nor custom scripts\nTags the artifacts\nPushes the artifacts\nDeploys the artifacts\nMonitors the deployed artifacts\nCleans up deployed artifacts on exit (Ctrl+C)\n\n\nNote\nAny of these stages can be skipped.\n\nAmphitheatre also automatically manages the following utilities for you:\n\nport-forwarding of deployed resources to your local machine using kubectl port-forward\nlog aggregation from the deployed pods\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/","title":"Introduction"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/","title":"CLI Manual"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/apply/":{"body":"Apply hydrated manifests to a cluster\nUsage\namp apply [options]\n\nOptions\n    --assume-yes=false: If true, amp will skip yes/no confirmation from the user and default to yes\n-c, --config='': File for global configurations (defaults to $HOME/.amp/config)\n-f, --filename='.amp.toml': Path or URL to the Amphitheatre config file\n    --force=false: Recreate Kubernetes resources if necessary for deployment, warning: might cause downtime!\n    --iterative-status-check=false: Run `status-check` iteratively after each deploy step, instead of all-together at the end of all deploys (default).\n    --kube-context='': Deploy to this Kubernetes context\n    --kubeconfig='': Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.\n-m, --module=[]: Filter Amphitheatre configs to only the provided named modules\n-n, --namespace='': Run deployments in the specified namespace\n-p, --profile=[]: Activate profiles by name (prefixed with `-` to disable a profile)\n    --remote-cache-dir='': Specify the location of the git repositories cache (default $HOME/.amp/repos)\n    --status-check=: Wait for deployed resources to stabilize\n    --sync-remote-cache='always': Controls how Amphitheatre manages the remote config cache (see `remote-cache-dir`).

All automated tests will still run against the PR, but the PR will not be assigned for review. Once a PR is ready for review, transition it from Draft mode, and code owners will be notified.\nPre-Requisites for PR Merge\nIn order for a PR to be merged, the following conditions should exist: \n\nThe PR has passed all the automated tests (style, build &amp; conformance tests). \nPR commits have been signed with the --signoff option. \nPR was reviewed and approved by a code owner. \nPR is rebased against upstream's master branch.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/testing/","title":"Testing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/references/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/references/","title":"References"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/references/manifest/":{"body":"The .amp.toml file for each character is called its manifest. It is written\nin the TOML format. Every manifest file consists of the following sections:\n\n[character] — Defines a character.\n\nname — The name of the character.\nversion — The version of the character.\nauthors — The authors of the character.\ndescription — A description of the character.\nreadme — Path to the character's README file.\nhomepage — URL of the character homepage.\nrepository — URL of the character source repository.\nlicense — The character license.\nlicense-file — Path to the text of the license.\nkeywords — Keywords for the character.\ncategories — Categories of the character.\nexclude — Files to exclude when publishing.\ninclude — Files to include when publishing.\npublish — Can be used to prevent publishing the character.\n\n\nPartner tables:\n\n[partners] — Partner dependencies.\n\n\n\nThe [character] section\nThe first section in a .amp.toml is [character].\n[character]\nname = \"hello_world\" # the name of the character\nversion = \"0.1.0\"    # the current version, obeying semver\nauthors = [\"Alice &lt;a@example.com&gt;\", \"Bob &lt;b@example.com&gt;\"]\n\nThe only fields required by Amphitheatre are name and\nversion. If publishing to a registry, the registry may\nrequire additional fields. See the notes below and the publishing\nchapter for requirements for publishing to Registry.\nThe name field\nThe character name is an identifier used to refer to the character. It is used\nwhen listed as a partner in another character, and as the default name of inferred target.\nThe name must use only alphanumeric characters or - or _, and cannot be empty.\nNote that amp init impose some additional restrictions on\nthe character name, such as enforcing that it is a valid Rust identifier and not\na keyword. Registry imposes even more restrictions, such as\nenforcing only ASCII characters, not a reserved name, not a special Windows\nname such as \"nul\", is not too long, etc.\nThe version field\nAmphitheatre bakes in the concept of Semantic\nVersioning, so make sure you follow some basic rules:\n\nUse version numbers with three numeric parts such as 1.0.0 rather than 1.0.\n\nThe authors field\nThe optional authors field lists people or organizations that are considered\nthe \"authors\" of the character. The exact meaning is open to interpretation — it\nmay list the original or primary authors, current maintainers, or owners of the\ncharacter. An optional email address may be included within angled brackets at\nthe end of each author entry.\n\nWarning: Character manifests cannot be changed once published, so this\nfield cannot be changed or removed in already-published versions of a\ncharacter.\n\nThe description field\nThe description is a short blurb about the character. Registry will display\nthis with your character. This should be plain text (not Markdown).\n[character]\n# ...\ndescription = \"A short description of my character\"\n\n\nNote: Registry requires the description to be set.\n\nThe readme field\nThe readme field should be the path to a file in the character root (relative\nto this .amp.toml) that contains general information about the character.\nThis file will be transferred to the registry when you publish. Registry\nwill interpret it as Markdown and render it on the character's page.\n[character]\n# ...\nreadme = \"README.md\"\n\nIf no value is specified for this field, and a file named README.md,\nREADME.txt or README exists in the character root, then the name of that\nfile will be used. You can suppress this behavior by setting this field to\nfalse. If the field is set to true, a default value of README.md will\nbe assumed.\nThe homepage field\nThe homepage field should be a URL to a site that is the home page for your\ncharacter.\n[character]\n# ...\nhomepage = \"https://example.com/\"\n\nThe repository field\nThe repository field should be a URL to the source repository for your\ncharacter.\n[character]\n# ...\nrepository = \"https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/amp-example-go/\"\n\nThe license and license-file fields\nThe license field contains the name of the software license that the character\nis released under. The license-file field contains the path to a file\ncontaining the text of the license (relative to this .amp.toml).\nRegistry interprets the license field as an SPDX 2.1 license\nexpression. The name must be a known license\nfrom the SPDX license list 3.11. Parentheses are not\ncurrently supported. See the SPDX site for more information.\nSPDX license expressions support AND and OR operators to combine multiple\nlicenses.\n[character]\n# ...\nlicense = \"MIT OR Apache-2.0\"\n\nUsing OR indicates the user may choose either license. Using AND indicates\nthe user must comply with both licenses simultaneously. The WITH operator\nindicates a license with a special exception. Some examples:\n\nMIT OR Apache-2.0\nLGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause\nGPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2\n\nIf a character is using a nonstandard license, then the license-file field may\nbe specified in lieu of the license field.\n[character]\n# ...\nlicense-file = \"LICENSE.txt\"\n\n\nNote: Registry requires either license or license-file to be set.\n\nThe keywords field\nThe keywords field is an array of strings that describe this character. This\ncan help when searching for the character on a registry, and you may choose any\nwords that would help someone find this character.\n[character]\n# ...\nkeywords = [\"gamedev\", \"graphics\"]\n\n\nNote: Registry has a maximum of 5 keywords. Each keyword must be\nASCII text, start with a letter, and only contain letters, numbers, _ or\n-, and have at most 20 characters.\n\nThe categories field\nThe categories field is an array of strings of the categories this character\nbelongs to.\ncategories = [\"command-line-utilities\", \"development-tools::build-plugins\"]\n\n\nNote: Registry has a maximum of 5 categories. Each category should\nmatch one of the strings available at https://registry.amphitheatre.app/category_slugs, and\nmust match exactly.\n\nThe exclude and include fields\nThe exclude and include fields can be used to explicitly specify which\nfiles are included when packaging a character to be published,\nand certain kinds of change tracking (described below).\nThe patterns specified in the exclude field identify a set of files that are\nnot included, and the patterns in include specify files that are explicitly\nincluded.\n[character]\n# ...\nexclude = [\"/ci\", \"images/\", \".*\"]\n\n[character]\n# ...\ninclude = [\"/src\", \"COPYRIGHT\", \"/examples\", \"!/examples/big_example\"]\n\nThe default if neither field is specified is to include all files from the\nroot of the character, except for the exclusions listed below.\nIf include is not specified, then the following files will be excluded:\n\nIf the character is not in a git repository, all \"hidden\" files starting with\na dot will be skipped.\nIf the character is in a git repository, any files that are ignored by the\ngitignore rules of the repository and global git configuration will be\nskipped.\n\nRegardless of whether exclude or include is specified, the following files\nare always excluded:\n\nAny sub-character will be skipped (any subdirectory that contains a\n.amp.toml file).\nA directory named target in the root of the character will be skipped.\n\nThe following files are always included:\n\nThe .amp.toml file of the character itself is always included, it does not\nneed to be listed in include.\nA minimized .amp.playbook is automatically included if the character contains a\nbinary or example target.\nIf a license-file is specified, it\nis always included.\n\nThe options are mutually exclusive; setting include will override an\nexclude. If you need to have exclusions to a set of include files, use the\n! operator described below.\nThe patterns should be gitignore-style patterns. Briefly:\n\nfoo matches any file or directory with the name foo anywhere in the\ncharacter. This is equivalent to the pattern **/foo.\n/foo matches any file or directory with the name foo only in the root of\nthe character.\nfoo/ matches any directory with the name foo anywhere in the character.\nCommon glob patterns like *, ?, and [] are supported:\n\n* matches zero or more characters except /.  For example, *.html\nmatches any file or directory with the .html extension anywhere in the\ncharacter.\n? matches any character except /. For example, foo? matches food,\nbut not foo.\n[] allows for matching a range of characters. For example, [ab]\nmatches either a or b. [a-z] matches letters a through z.\n\n\n**/ prefix matches in any directory. For example, **/foo/bar matches the\nfile or directory bar anywhere that is directly under directory foo.\n/** suffix matches everything inside. For example, foo/** matches all\nfiles inside directory foo, including all files in subdirectories below\nfoo.\n/**/ matches zero or more directories. For example, a/**/b matches\na/b, a/x/b, a/x/y/b, and so on.\n! prefix negates a pattern. For example, a pattern of src/*.rs and\n!foo.rs would match all files with the .rs extension inside the src\ndirectory, except for any file named foo.rs.\n\nThe publish field\nThe publish field can be used to prevent a character from being published to a\ncharacter registry (like Registry) by mistake, for instance to keep a character\nprivate in a company.\n[character]\n# ...\npublish = false\n\nThe value may also be an array of strings which are registry names that are\nallowed to be published to.\n[character]\n# ...\npublish = [\"some-registry-name\"]\n\nIf publish array contains a single registry, amp publish command will use\nit when --registry flag is not specified.\nPartner sections\nSee the specifying partners page for\ninformation on the [partners] section.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/references/manifest/","title":"The Manifest Format"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":276,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/apply/":{"body":248,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/build/":{"body":511,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/clean/":{"body":244,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/completion/":{"body":22,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/config/":{"body":247,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/debug/":{"body":715,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/deploy/":{"body":601,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/dev/":{"body":735,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/diagnose/":{"body":202,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/fix/":{"body":182,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/init/":{"body":230,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/options/":{"body":45,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/overview/":{"body":195,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/render/":{"body":407,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/run/":{"body":677,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/schema/":{"body":50,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/survey/":{"body":33,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/test/":{"body":271,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cli/version/":{"body":34,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/development/":{"body":75,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/documentation/":{"body":166,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/maintainers/":{"body":73,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/overview/":{"body":75,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/promotion/":{"body":90,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/contributing/testing/":{"body":92,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/references/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/references/manifest/":{"body":850,"title":2}},"length":30},"lang":"English"};
