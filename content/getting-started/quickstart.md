Learn how to start using Amphitheatre on an example project that is hosted on GitHub in less than 5 minutes. For simplicity we use GitHub as the git hoster but the steps outlined work equally well for GitLab and Bitbucket. This section helps you understand the features and advantages of Amphitheatre in a learning environment. 

> **Note**\
We are actively working on adding to our quickstart library. In the meantime, you can explore Amphitheatre through our tutorials.

## Before you begin
- [Set up your local Amphitheatre environment](@/getting-started/installation.md).

All templates are pre-configured to use Amphitheatre and ready-to-code:
