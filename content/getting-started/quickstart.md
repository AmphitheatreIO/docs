Learn how to start using Amphitheatre on an example project that is hosted on
GitHub in less than 5 minutes. For simplicity we use GitHub as the git hoster
but the steps outlined work equally well for GitLab and Bitbucket. This section
helps you understand the features and advantages of Amphitheatre in a learning
environment.

> **Note**\
We are actively working on adding to our quickstart library. In the meantime,
you can explore Amphitheatre through our tutorials.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to [Set up your local Amphitheatre environment](@/getting-started/installation/_index.md).

## Templates

All templates are pre-configured to use Amphitheatre and ready-to-code:

{{ grid(columns=2) }}
{{ column() }}{{ card(title="More on Golang", url="/getting-started/quickstart/go", color="text-bg-light") }}{{ end() }}
{{ column() }}{{ card(title="More on Java Spring", url="/getting-started/quickstart/java") }}{{ end() }}
{{ column() }}{{ card(title="More on NodeJs - Express", url="/getting-started/quickstart/nodejs") }}{{ end() }}
{{ column() }}{{ card(title="More on Python Flask", url="/getting-started/quickstart/python") }}{{ end() }}
{{ column() }}{{ card(title="More on Rust", url="/getting-started/quickstart/rust") }}{{ end() }}
{{ column() }}{{ card(title="More on Svelte", url="/getting-started/quickstart/svelte") }}{{ end() }}
{{ end() }}

If you encounter any errors during this process, check that you have installed
all the prerequisites in Requirements. If you still have issues, see
Troubleshooting.
