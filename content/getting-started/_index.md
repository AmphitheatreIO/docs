> **Amphitheatre Concepts**\
If you are looking for an introductory overview of Amphitheatre and learn more
about basic Amphitheatre terminology, we recommend starting with the concepts
section.

Our getting started guide will walk you through a series of steps to install,
initialize, experiment with, and start using Amphitheatre.

If you run into any issues while following these steps, please reach out to us
in the Amphitheatre Discord community.
