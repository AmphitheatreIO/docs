## 1. Install API Server

Once **Helm** has been set up correctly, add the repo and install the chart with
the release name `amp` as follows:

```sh
helm repo add amphitheatre https://charts.amphitheatre.app
helm install amp amphitheatre/amphitheatre --create-namespace --namespace amp-system
```

For more advanced installation configurations see [Installing API
Server](@/installation/api-server.md).

## 2. Configure the cluster

After installing Amphitheatre, you need to initialize some configurations, one
of the more important ones being the configuration of credentials.

Create a `Secret` with push credentials for the Docker Registry that you plan on
publishing OCI images to with [`Builder`](@/concepts/builders.md). Your
configuration create should look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: amp-credentials
  namespace: amp-system
stringData:
  credentials: |
    [[registries]]
    name = "Docker Hub"
    default = true
    server = "https://index.docker.io/v1/"
    username = "<username>"
    password = "<password>"
    token = "<token>"

    [[repositories]]
    name = "GitHub"
    driver = "github"
    server = "https://github.com"
    username = "<username>"
    password = "<password>"
    token = "<token>"
```

Apply that configuration to the cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -n amp-system -f amp-credentials.yaml
```

For more advanced configurations see [Configure the
Amphitheatre](@/installation/configuration.md).

## 3. Install CLI

Amphitheatre CLI can be installed by using various package managers on Linux,
macOS and Windows. The precompiled binaries are available from the [**GitHub
releases page**](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli/releases). Simply
download the appropriate binary and add it to your `PATH`.

For detailed install instructions, follow the guide for your operating system.
Copy and paste one of the following commands in your terminal:

```
# For Linux on x86_64 (amd64)
curl -L https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli/releases/download/latest/amp-linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
tar -xzf amp-linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
sudo install amp /usr/local/bin/
```

```
# For macOS on aarch64 (arm64)
curl -L https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli/releases/download/latest/amp-darwin-arm64.tar.gz && \
tar -xzf amp-darwin-arm64.tar.gz && \
sudo install amp /usr/local/bin/
```

```
docker run ghcr.io/amphitheatre-app/amp:latest <command>
```

After you install Amphitheatre CLI, verify that you installed it correctly with:

```
amp version
```

For more advanced installation configurations see [Installing CLI](@/installation/cli.md).
