Amphitheatre CLI can be installed by using various package managers on Linux, macOS and Windows.
The precompiled binaries are available from the [**GitHub releases page**](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli/releases).
Simply download the appropriate binary and add it to your `PATH`.

For detailed install instructions, follow the guide for your operating system.

1. First, visit the following link to download the file:

    [https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli/releases/download/latest/amp-windows-amd64.zip](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/cli/releases/download/latest/amp-windows-amd64.zip)

    Click on the link, and your browser will begin downloading the compressed file (`amp-windows-amd64.zip`).

2. Once the download is complete, you can extract the file to a directory of
    your choice. You can do this using the built-in decompression tool of your
    operating system or a third-party compression tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR.

3. After extraction, you will have an executable file named `amp.exe``.

4. Finally, add the `amp.exe` file to your `PATH` environment variable so that
   you can conveniently run the `amp` command from any location.

### Scoop

Amphitheatre CLI can be installed using the Scoop package manager from the
extras bucket. This package is not maintained by the Amphitheatre team.

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install amp
```

### Chocolatey

Amphitheatre CLI can be installed using the Chocolatey package manager. This
package is not maintained by the Amphitheatre team.

> **Caution**\
Chocolateyâ€™s installation mechanism interferes with Ctrl+C handling and prevents
amp from cleaning up deployments. This cannot be fixed by Amphitheatre CLI. For
more information about this defect see chocolatey/shimgen#32.

```
choco install -y amp
```

{{ end() }}
